## Welcome!
There isn't a whole lot here yet!

You can get started by taking a look at our repository's [README](https://github.com/restauwants/restauwants?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) which contains additional installation instructions. You can get started by browsing pages for our three [personas](/restauwants/personas).

You can also take a look at the [script](/restauwants/research/interviews/v2/script) used for our Milestone 1 research.

Lastly, there are a few [UI mockups](/restauwants/ui-ux/mockups) mockups available for viewing.
